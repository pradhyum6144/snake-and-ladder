ðŸŽ² Snake and Ladder Game

ðŸ”·The Snake and Ladder game is a simple board game where players roll a dice and move their tokens based on the number rolled. The twist is that if a player lands at the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to a higher number if they land on a snake's head, they slide down to a lower number.
